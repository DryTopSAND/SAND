A guild site for the Guild Wars 2 guild [SAND] - That's No Tornado

:tada:

## How to Update the Calendar

Calendar is hosted on Google Calendar, so  contact one of the guild officers if something needs changed


### File Location

[Link](calendar/events.json)

### How To Edit

Go to the above file and on the right side of the file click the pencil icon.

Then copy and paste the example code at the bottom of the list of events, second line from the end (aka not the `]`, above it), just editing the start and end times to be what you need.

Then in the bottom of the page, write a description for what change you're making, like the default `Update events.json`.
Proper convention is to make the first word a present tense verb, and keep it short and sweet. The description is optional.

Then click the Commit button. You should be able to then refresh the site and it'll be updated with the event!
